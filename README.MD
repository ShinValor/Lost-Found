# Android Final Project

My application is called Lost&Found. It is an Android application that allows CUNY students to post what they lost or found. The application has to main tab, Lost and Found tab. Lost tab is for user who lost their items on campus, whether it’s laptop or water bottle. The Found tab is for user who found items through the campus, for example school ID. To user this app, user will have to create post to let other users know what he/she lost or found. To create a post the user will have to take a photo, and write a description of it. For example, “I found this water bottle on the 4th floor library next to the computer lab”. If the owner of the item see the posting, he/she can contact the user who found the item through Message, Call or Track. Users can message each other by using the built-in messaging system. They can talk to each other and decide whether to meet up to return the item to the owner. Beside messaging, users can call each other if preferred. However, in order to return the item to the owner, the Track feature must be used. Track is a feature that send an email to the user who found the item so that he/she can contact the owner of the item. When clicked on Track, user must fill in a form to verify the user identify, e.g. full name, school id, phone number. Then the user need to sign the form through the built-in signature pad to accept the terms and conditions.
